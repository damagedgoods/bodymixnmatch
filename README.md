# Body Mix n' Match

Illustrator script to generate multiple combinations of different character parts

# Instructions

Just edit the groups head1, head2, body1, body2, etc. and replace them with your own designs. Make sure there are no repeated group names. Once you are finished, run the script: "File > Script > Other script..." (or something like that) and select src/bodies.jsx.

You can change the numbers of items in the "numBichos" variable in bodies.jsx

You can also check the video tutorial in the root directory.

# Support

I won't be providing any bug support and I'm not planning to maintain this. Sorry. But you can take the script and use it as you wish.
